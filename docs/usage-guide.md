# StairSit Usage Guide

Welcome to the StairSit plugin! This guide will help you understand how to use the plugin and its features.

## Sitting on Stairs

To sit on a stair, simply right-click it while standing on it. This will trigger the sitting action. No additional commands are required.

## Customizing the Plugin

Though StairSit is designed to work out-of-the-box, if you wish to customize its functionality, you may add custom configuration files in the future (though none are required at the moment).
